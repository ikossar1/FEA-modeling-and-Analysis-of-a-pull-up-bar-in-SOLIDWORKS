# FEA modeling and Analysis in SOLIDWORKS 

As part of project and lab work in Materials and Manufacturing I and Mechanics I, I modeled a pull-up bar (employing mates) and ran a simulation study integrating load, mesh, advanced fixtures, connections, and material choice. With the outputted data, I created and analyzed normal stress and displacement plots utilizing the probing function. I made theoretical calculations of the max normal stress and deflection of a pull-up bar by hand and compared them to the results of the FEA model.
